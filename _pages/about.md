# About Us

Welcome to the Privacy-Preserving AI Group at TUM! We are a passionate collective of computer science students from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) dedicated to exploring and advancing the cutting-edge intersection of artificial intelligence and privacy.

Our mission is to foster a collaborative community of students, researchers, and industry professionals who are enthusiastic about privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. We focus on exciting areas such as federated learning, differential privacy, and the application of AI in medicine, always with a keen eye on maintaining data privacy and security.

## Our Vision

We believe that as AI continues to revolutionize various sectors, it's crucial to develop and promote methods that protect individual privacy while harnessing the power of data. Our group serves as a hub for learning, discussion, and innovation in this critical field.

## Activities

We organize a variety of engaging events to promote knowledge sharing and community building:

- **Talks and Workshops**: We host regular presentations on topics like federated learning, differential privacy, and AI in healthcare, featuring both student research and guest speakers from academia and industry.
- **Reading Groups**: We dive deep into the latest research papers and developments in privacy-preserving AI techniques.
- **Hackathons**: We organize hands-on events where participants can apply privacy-preserving ML techniques to real-world problems.
- **Industry Collaborations**: We facilitate connections with companies working on privacy-preserving AI, offering insights into practical applications and career opportunities.

## Join Us

Whether you're a beginner curious about privacy in AI or an experienced researcher looking to share your knowledge, we welcome you to join our community. Together, we can shape the future of AI that respects and protects privacy.

Stay tuned for our upcoming events and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to get involved!
