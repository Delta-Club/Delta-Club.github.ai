# Advancing Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach to train machine learning models on distributed datasets without compromising individual privacy. At PrivaTUM, we're excited to announce our latest research project focusing on enhancing privacy guarantees in federated learning systems.

## Project Highlights

- Developing novel cryptographic protocols for secure aggregation
- Implementing differential privacy techniques to protect against inference attacks
- Exploring the trade-offs between model accuracy and privacy preservation

Our team is collaborating with industry partners to test these methods on real-world datasets, ensuring that our research has practical applications in fields such as healthcare and finance.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress and upcoming publications!
